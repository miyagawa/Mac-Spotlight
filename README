Mac-Spotlight-MDQuery version 0.01
==================================

Mac-Spotlight provides a Perl API to the Spotlight service on OS X,
specifically via Core Foundation's MDQuery and MDItem APIs.

This is very much a beta version. It is not totally feature complete
(see TODO) and probably has bugs. Please email bug reports to the
below email address.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Mac-Spotlight does not have any dependencies on other Perl modules. It
does require Mac OS 10.4 or higher and Perl 5.8.x or higher. If you
have Mac OS 10.4 the default Perl is at least 5.8.6.

TODO

We don't support all the options that can be set in an MDQuery. Although
most of those options have to do with asychronous queries which we don't 
do.

There should be a way to get more than one attribute at a time via
MDItem::get(), and there should be something like MDItem::get_all()
which returns a complete set of relevant attributes in a hash.
